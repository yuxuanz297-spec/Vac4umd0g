a new algorithm that can help car dodging obstacles urgently more smooth and safe by using the function of Gaussian.
The descriptions are mostly Chinese,so you may need google translators to read them.The most part of the algorithm is written by myself,a minority generated by AI.It took me 7 days to finish this.The system is based on pyboard v1.1.And the parts of the car's driving constitute are electrical machines,which can be bought online at a cheap price.The core of the algorithm is the PWM speed controling algorithm,which uses the Gaussian function.The merits are as follows:
1.
the function is defined as quick falling function,which meets the need of mutation of the speed of each tyres at urgent circumstances.
2.
the function is easy to debug,there is only 3 coefficients:the coefficient of the left/right,the coefficient of the function itself and the coefficient of the expoential power.
